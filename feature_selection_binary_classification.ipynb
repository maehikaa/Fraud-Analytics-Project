    "This feature selection notebook does a filter followed by a wrapper for a binary dependent variable (binary classification). It's capable of doing the filter on more than one file. The variable files are called vars1.csv, vars2.csv ... Or you can make the input file name(s) anything you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter runs separately on each vars file and keeps the top num_filter variables from each file. If there are more than one vars files we'll again select the top num_filter variables across all the vars.csv files.\n",
    "\n",
    "If balance = 0 the entire files are used. If balance != 0 then balance is the RATIO OF BADS TO GOODS retained for the rest of the feature selection. We keep all the rare class (bads) and downsample the goods. I think in general it's better to keep balance = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter is pretty fast. The wrapper is what takes the most time. The two most important paramenters are the number of variables you want to save from the filter (num_filter) and the number you want from the wrapper (num_wrapper). \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a parameter njobs that controls the # threads used in the wrapper. Set it to 1 for a single thread and it should work fine, but you might be able to succeed with njobs = -1, which lets the machine set the maximum # threads based on the CPU. With this setting the kernel may die because of memory. The njobs = -1 doesn't take into consideration the memory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations: Try a few simple runs just to make sure all's working. Start with num_filter = 20, num_wrapper = 5, increase from there. I like num_filter as high as around 10 to 20% of the # candidate variables, but not much higher than a few hundred. You don't need num_wrapper large if you're doing forward selection. Most problems will saturate before 20. You can try a few different simple wrapper models like RF (5 trees, 10 layers), catboost (10 trees, 3 layers), LGBM (same). They're pretty fast. You can try forward and backward. I'd start with forward. In the end, select one of these as your favorite run and go with those variables. Don't mix variables across different runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find forward selection runs much faster than backward.\n",
